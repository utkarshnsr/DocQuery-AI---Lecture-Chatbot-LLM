<h1>Web Application for PDF Document Querying</h1>

I developed a web application that allows users to input PDF documents (let it be lectures or other useful documents) and ask questions about their content using an integrated chatbot. This application leverages several powerful technologies and libraries to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

Python was used as the core programming language for developing the backend of the application.

LangChain was used for the RAG process and connecting LLMs for answering user's questions.

This application uses Gemini model for chatbot.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) was employed for efficient vector search operations, allowing for quick and precise retrieval of relevant document sections based on user queries.

![Streamlit](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1640050215/image27_frqkzv.png)

Streamlit was used to create an intuitive and user-friendly web interface, making it easy for users to upload PDFs and interact with the chatbot.
