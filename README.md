<h1>Web Application for PDF Document Querying</h1>

I developed a web application that allows users to input PDF documents (let it be lectures or other useful documents) and ask questions about their content using an integrated chatbot. This application leverages several powerful technologies and libraries to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.

Python was used as the core programming language for developing the backend of the application.

LangChain was used for the RAG process and connecting LLMs for answering user's questions.
